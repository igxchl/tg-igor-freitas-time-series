 The time series competitions are gaining increasingly popularity among the data science community, especially the M competition, that has existed for more than 40 years. In these contests many methods are tested chasing the best fit. Models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Naïve-Bayes, XGboost and Neural Nets often appear in the séries forecasting literature, this paper will use those models in a practical application and method choosing. To select the best one of these it is necessary to pick up a cohesive data source, treat the data for the fit in analysis and define a proper accuracy estimator. The database selected contains information of opening, closing, high and low daily values of Microsoft Corporation stock price in the United States stock exchange of 723 days, spreaded in 150 weeks. This choice was made because of the high availability of this kind of data and the great notoriety of the company around the world, which reinforces the practical purpose of this study. In this paper these techniques are exploited with the purpose of demonstrating all the stages of the process of analysis and performance testing of the forecast methods, which will launch a proper knowledge base for selecting the best of those models for returns forecasts.
